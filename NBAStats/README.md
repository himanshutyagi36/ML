# NBAStats
A model for predicting a dream team.
## Dataset: 
NBA Player Statistics (2, attached)

## Prompt: 
Based on the dataset, create your best 5 person dream team with 1 player in each of their respective positions (PG, SG, SF, PF, C). Caveat - you can only use 1 player per decade and within the past 5 decades (aka - 2010's, 2000's, 1990's, 1980's, 1970's). If a player has played at least 1 game in multiple decades, you can use them for whichever decade you prefer.

Once your rockstar team is assembled, predict the number of points they will score in the upcoming season.
